          <hr class="hr_line" />
          <p>
            Ronnie Dean Coleman was born in Monroe, Louisiana, on May 13, 1964.
            He graduated cum laude from Grambling State University in 1984 with
            a BSc in accounting. While there, he played football as a middle
            linebacker with the GSU Tigers under coach Eddie Robinson. After
            graduation, he failed to find work as an accountant and instead went
            to work at Domino's Pizza, where he would eat the complimentary
            pizza every day due to being so poor that he could barely afford to
            eat outside of work. He then became a police officer in Arlington,
            Texas, serving as an officer from 1989 to 2000 and a reserve officer
            until 2003.
          </p>
          <h2 class="page_subtitle">Bodybuilding career</h2>
          <hr class="hr_line" />
          <p>
            Coleman's fellow officer Gustavo Arlotta suggested he attend the
            Metroflex gym, owned by amateur bodybuilder Brian Dobson. Dobson
            offered Coleman a free lifetime membership if he allowed Dobson to
            train him for the upcoming 1990 Mr. Texas bodybuilding
            competition.[17] After training for Mr. Texas, Coleman won first
            place in both the heavyweight and overall categories. He also
            defeated Dobson himself. Coleman won his first competition as a
            professional, the Canada Pro Cup, in 1995. The following year, he
            won the contest again, then went on to win the 1997 Russian Grand
            Prix. He also participated in powerlifting competitions in the
            mid-1990s.[18]
          </p>
          <p>
            His rise at the top in the professional circuit of bodybuilding was
            relatively slow: for his first participation at the Mr. Olympia
            contest (the most prestigious worldwide) in 1992, he wasn't ranked;
            then in 1994 he placed 15th, then 10th in 1995, 6th in 1996, and 9th
            in 1997 when Dorian Yates won his sixth and last title before
            retiring.[19] The following year, Kenneth Wheeler was favored to
            become the 10th individual Mr. Olympia titleholder, with predominant
            competition coming from Nasser El Sonbaty, Kevin Levrone, and Shawn
            Ray. However, Coleman—whose Night of Champions victory earlier in
            the year had considerably elevated his esteem in the bodybuilding
            world—brought substantial improvements to the stage and went on to
            defeat Wheeler by three points for his first Mr. Olympia win.[19]
            Coleman defended his title all the way through the 2005 contest,
            earning a total of eight consecutive victories and tying Lee Haney
            as the most successful Mr. Olympia in history. In 2001, he became
            the first man to win both the Arnold Classic and the Mr. Olympia
            titles the same year (only Dexter Jackson has repeated this feat, in
            2008). Coleman's reign as Mr. Olympia came to an end in 2006 when
            Jay Cutler, the three-time consecutive runner-up heading into the
            contest, finally earned his first win. It was only the second time
            in contest history that a reigning multi-champion Mr. Olympia had
            lost his title (as opposed to retiring). The previous instance
            occurred when Arnold Schwarzenegger defeated Sergio Oliva in 1970.
            Coleman made his final Mr. Olympia appearance in 2007, placing 4th.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coleman's success as a professional bodybuilder has led to many
            product endorsements and other opportunities in his career, which he
            has traveled the world to promote.[20] He has made many guest
            appearances at gym openings around the U.S. When training, he
            preferred to use free weights rather than machines in order to
            maximize his flexibility and range of motion. He has made three
            training videos: The Unbelievable,[21] The Cost of Redemption,[22]
            and On the Road.[23] In these videos, he gives tips for more
            experienced weightlifters, while warning against overexertion and
            improper form.
          </p>

          <p>
            Coleman supports the Inner City Games, an organization co-founded by
            Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1991. He was the recipient of the 2001
            Admiral in the Texas Navy Certificate Award from Texas Governor Rick
            Perry for outstanding achievements in bodybuilding and for the
            promotion of physical fitness.[24] In 2011, he launched Ronnie
            Coleman Signature Series, a company that provides sports nutrition
            and wellness products for bodybuilders and other athletes.[25]
          </p>
          <p>
            The extreme weights Coleman used over the course of his career
            competing as a powerlifter and bodybuilder, such as squats and
            deadlifts with 800 lbs, took a toll on his body and he has undergone
            numerous surgeries since 2007. These include two hip replacements
            and various attempts at alleviating chronic pain from damaged
            intervertebral discs.[26] He has continued to train despite his
            deteriorated condition, but can only use light weights now, to try
            to prevent muscle loss as of 2018,[27] and some of his surgeries
            (each one costing between $300,000 and $500,000) had such poor
            outcomes that he may never be able to walk unassisted again.[28]
            Coleman uses a wheelchair if he has to travel long distances.[29]
            However, he has said that he does not regret his choices and admits
            that he was determined to be the best bodybuilder at any cost; he
            said that, if anything, he regrets not having done even more to
            consolidate his legacy.[26]

          <p>
            In 2018, Vlad Yudin documented Coleman's life and career in the
            Netflix documentary Ronnie Coleman: The King.[15] For the film's
            credits, rapper Quan made a song called "Flexin' on Them (Ronnie
            Coleman)" inspired by Coleman's bodybuilding career.[30]
